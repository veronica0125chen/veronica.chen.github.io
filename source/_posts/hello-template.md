Myths around “if you antenatal training than your baby will develop smarter”

As people continue to explore the life sciences, mothers, during pregnancy, are beginning to develop new interests in antenatal education. Some mothers-to-be believe that antenatal education can promote the development of the fetus's brain and nervous system and make the baby more intelligent. The baby will be born with higher adaptability, such as in music and speech. To explore this question, one should consider a premise - can a fetus learn?

It is known to all that the human brain has various functions, including cognition, sensory, and learning, and that the nervous system that makes up the brain becomes active during prenatal development. Fetal action planning begins to be established as early as the 22nd week and continues to increase the complexity of fetal behaviour as the weeks of pregnancy increase; from the 25th week of gestation, the fetal cerebral cortex can process sensory stimuli, and after another nine weeks, the fetus can perceive and discriminate between different sounds, which all show that he fetal learning and memory capacity is extraordinary (Kadic, 2018) [1].

Therefore, the fetal brain is sufficient to support its learning and motor abilities in the face of external stimuli. So does fetal education make the fetus smarter?

Unfortunately, there is no evidence that antenatal education directly affects fetal intelligence. However, it is undeniable that pregnant women who undergo antenatal education are in a better mood and that the mental health of pregnant women has a positive impact on fetal development (Kwan Hong, 2020) [2].

In conclusion, keeping the mother in a good mood during pregnancy is the secret to a healthier child and mother. As for how to make embryos smarter, we need more research.
