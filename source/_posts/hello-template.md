Myths around “if you antenatal training than your baby will develop smarter”

With the continuous exploration of life sciences, mothers during pregnancy have started to develop new interest and knowledge about fetal education. Some mothers-to-be believe that fetal education can promote the development of the fetus' brain nervous system and is beneficial to the development of the baby's mental health, so that the baby will be born with higher adaptability, such as in music, speech, etc. However, another part of the population believes that fetal education does not have a substantial effect. In order to explore this question, one should first think about a premise - can a fetus learn?

We know that the human brain has various functions, including cognition, sensory, learning, etc., and that the nervous system that makes up the brain becomes active during prenatal development. "The fetus begins processing sensory stimuli, including painful stimuli, at the cortical level from about 25 weeks of gestation. At the 34th gestational week, the fetus is able to perceive not only complex external sounds but also to discriminate between different sounds. Fetal action planning is established by 22 weeks, and investigations with 4-dimensional ultrasound show that the complexity of fetal motor movements and behaviors increases as pregnancy progresses. The fetal learning and memory capacity is amazing. " DOI: 10.1055/s-0043-123469

So it is true that the fetal brain is sufficient to support its learning and motor abilities in the face of external stimuli. So can fetal education really transmit information (e.g. stimuli or sounds, etc.) to the fetus?

Unfortunately, there is no evidence that fetal education has a direct educational impact on the fetus, but it is undeniable that pregnant women who undergo fetal education are in a better mood and that the mental health of the pregnant woman has a positive impact on the development of the fetus.
